      <div class = "projectp">
        <p>I was honored to have the opportunity to help develop various online web-based modules for the center of flexible learning at Seneca College (Markham). Throughout my time there, I learned to design courses and webpages with specific UI/UX conecerns regarding learners’ accessibility. I completed the development of one entire web-based course using html, css and JavaScript with the bootstrap framework.</p>

      <div class = "projectp">
        <p>This summer, I was lucky enough to become the lead co-director for a 400 participant hackathon that was supported with 18k thanks to generous sponsorships and partners. I managed a team of 15 coordinators responsible for different aspects of the event (sponsorship, design, HR, tech and logistics) throughout the 6 months of intense planning. We were responsible for all aspects of the hackathon before and during the event including contacting and maintaining professional relationships with our potential sponsors, contacting venue and food logistics, communicating between coordinator teams, maintaining the technical fluency of our project (ensuring webpage was updated, hardware was used correctly, etc.) as well as overseeing design works so they follow branding guidelines.

      <div class = "projectp">
        <p>For someone who never touched a line of code in high school, developing this website from scratch was a mission that could only be accomplished with the help of Google searches and Stackoverflow. It took me a month and nights of wire framing, illustrating, designing, and coding to create what you see today. Since I had experience with Bootstrap aided web development from Seneca, I wanted to try something new and decided to create this whole thing from scratch!</p>

      <div class = "projectp">
        <p>Findr is a crowd management app my teammates and I created at DeltaHacks IV (my very first hackathon!) to enhance students studying experience. Our team’s task delegation was extremely clear as we needed to finish the project under a strict time constraint. I was in charge of doing the aesthetic design and branding of our product. Using illustrator, I designed our logo and a digital wire frame of the app with the user experience in mind. In the demo, I made sure to use no true black or whites as staring at these colors for a prolonged period of time could strain the eyes, instead, we used off whites and chose bright accent colors to provide users with a joyful greeting screen.</p>

		<p>Shottle is a product designed by six undergraduate engineering student aimed to improve the "health and wellness for upper year undergraduate students". As shown in the images, the bottle has two chambers (one intended for water, the other for alcohol) of different volumes to ensure users carry enough water with them when consuming alcohol. We engineered a spring loaded lid that automatically keeps the opening accessible to the water section to encourage water consumption.</p>
